# The source code in this folder has a series of (unoptimized) functions for you to test and compile.

These functions are the sort of things that might be useful in scientific and computational programming (read: your future work). 

Note that they have a fixed size N and fixed set of data types (integers)!

1. Your first step is to compile them all and check the latency and resource utilization

1. Once this is done, your next step is to vary N: make it smaller (N->4), bigger (N->64) and much bigger (N->128 or even try 1024). See how things change

1. After that, change the data types from integers to unsigned integers to longs to floats to doubles. How does latency change? Resource utilization? Note that ideally you would know the needed ranges and accuracy of each calculation so you could be more precise in the resources used for each variables. To be discussed later in the course!
